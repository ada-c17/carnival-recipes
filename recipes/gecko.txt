6 slices White Bread
7. Lay bacon slices over the top, tucking them underneath the meatloaf.
10 slices Thin/regular Bacon
11. Slice and serve with remaining sauce. Serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.
