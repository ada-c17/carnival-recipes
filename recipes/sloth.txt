Chris' Steamed Buns
-------------------

1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup water
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

3. Knead until dough surface is smooth and elastic. Roll over in a greased bowl, and let stand until triple in size, about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.
12. REMOVE LID BEFORE you turn off heat, or else water will drip back onto bun surface and produce yellowish "blisters" on bun surfaces.


4. Punch down dough, and spread out on a floured board.
8. Bring water to a boil in wok, and reduce heat to medium; the water should still be boiling.


Directions:

6. Divide dough into 2 parts, and place the piece you are not working with in a covered bowl. Divide each half into 12 parts.
9. Place steam-plate on a small wire rack in the middle of the wok.
