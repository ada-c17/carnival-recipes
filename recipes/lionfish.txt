Lisa's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Ingredients:
1 lb sliced onion
3 tablespoons instantized flour
grated zest of lemon (to garnish)
1 cup milk

1. Cut meat into 1-inch cubes.
3. Add meat cubes and brown.
6. Add stock or enough water just to cover meat.
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
